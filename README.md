# Mini-Challenge 1 - Solution

## Instructions:
Play around with the oracle (it's actually a 3-qubit circuit hidden away from you) in [this webpage](https://isaqc-official.github.io/qff/c1/) - pass different 3 qubit inputs - regular 000 to 111 or superposed states, observe the output and try to reconstruct that hidden circuit (there may be multiple circuits that work though) that gives the same outputs as the oracle in the webpage for all the inputs.

You can build your circuit using qiskit and upload the output image after running `QuantumCircuit.draw()`.\
**OR**\
You can use the [IBM Quantum Composer](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/composer) to just directly add gates and see if you're getting the same outputs in a more visual manner.

## Answer:
The answer has been uploaded both as an image `output.png` and as Qiskit code `code.py`.
